# Latent Space Particle Filter (LSPF) with Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

This repository contains the implementation of Latent Space Particle Filter (LSPF), a novel approach utilizing the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for particle filter and data assimilation.

Overview

LSPF is designed to leverage the latent space representation learned by a VAE to perform particle filtering efficiently. This method is particularly useful for data assimilation tasks where high-dimensional state representations can be effectively handled in a compressed latent space.

In this repository, we focus on applying the LSPF method to numerical experiments in sea ice data assimilation, demonstrating its effectiveness in assimilating observational data.

Features
	•	Implementation of LSPF: A novel approach for data assimilation using the latent space of a VAE.
	•	Numerical experiments: Application of LSPF to sea ice data assimilation problems.
	•	Annotated source code: The core functionalities are well-documented with inline comments and function descriptions.
